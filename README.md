## Features:
- **theming** Custom colors with css variables.
- **Responsive** Unpredictive layout thanks to CSS grid :)
- **Modules** for informations other than links.

## Built with
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) Blazing fast, zero configuration web application bundler
- [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) Pug is a template engine for Node and for the browser. It compiles to HTML and has a simplified syntax.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, you will need:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)- Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime that will help running javascript code   outside your browser

## Installation
1. Once nodeJs is installed, install Parcel globally on your machine.
    ```sh
    npm install -g parcel-bundler
    ```
2. Paste this command in your terminal to clone the repository inside the folder of your choice 
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:kikiklang/pomme-page.git
    ```
3. Still in your terminal, move into pomme-page freshly created folder and run this command to install all project dependencies
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Usage
 You can now open the project in your IDE and run this project locally
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

  To bundle your code - ready to ship, cleaned and lightweight
  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```

  To test your production build locally
  ```sh
  npm run serve
  ```

  To delete development, build and cache folders
  ```sh
  npm run clean
  ```

  To check and fix your js syntax and errors in code
  ```sh
  npm run lint
  ```

  To prettify your code
  ```sh
  npm run format
  ```

## Modules
Pomme Page use modules to display informations other than links. Currently, there is: 
- **clock** time & date
- **binance** past and current crypto currencies data
- **openweather** current weather (needs API key: [openweather](https://openweathermap.org/unsplash)) 
- **unsplash** random image display (needs API key: [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers))
- **stormglass** sea condition (needs API key: [stormglass](https://stormglass.io/))

Find the module in the `src` folder and his javascript file. You can add your api key here.

## Customization

### Layout
Layout is made with CSS grid, you can simply move things around in `src/index.pug` file

### Links
Links images work in svg format. To add a link, go to `src/index.pug` and make a myrtille. It's a pug function that takes 3 parameters:
- domain
- svg viewbox
- svg path

### Modules
- **binance**:  To get the crypto-currencies you want. Head to `src/binance/binance.pug` and change binance-selector-button value to desired currency symbols. Javascript will do the work behind.
- **openweather**:  you will need to provide the city name in `src/openweather/openweather.js` + units of measurement. standard, metric and imperial units are available.
- **unsplash**: you can provide another collection ID ([unsplash collections](https://unsplash.com/collections)) in `src/unsplash/unsplash.js` file
- **stormglass**: you will need latitude and longitude of your surf spot. Set the variables in `src/stormglass/stormglass.js`

To remove a module, you have to delete the corresponding folder in src and then remove all imports found in the 3 index files (pug, css, js).

### Colors
Colors theming is not perfect yet, but you cqn make your theme with the css variables found in `index.css`

## Contribution
Please feel free to give what you have in this project if you like it. It would nice to make:
- new modules
- new color themes
- fonts integration
- new icons
- refactor
- anything

## Deploying
After the build process, you'll find a `dist` folder that parcel just created. We still have API Keys in the code. In my case, i deploy this behind a caddy reverse proxy and limit/filter access to this static files only from my personal computer IP.
